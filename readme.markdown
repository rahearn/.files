# `.files`

Some people like to make an impression, this is mine. This repository contains
some of my useful little `.files` and scripts that I've amassed over the years
and were just too good to leave as [pure gists][pg].

[pg]: https://gists.github.com/rogeruiz "A living collection of the best ideas I just couldn't keep to myself. Also, kudos to you for reading and patiently waiting for this title to pop up in your browser! :)"

If any of the scripts here give you any trouble just complete the following
steps:

1. `cd path/to/this/repo`
2. `rm -rvf ./*`
